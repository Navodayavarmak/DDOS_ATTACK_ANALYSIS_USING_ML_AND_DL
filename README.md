distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack analysis using machine learning and deep learning

Distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a cybercrime that attempts to interrupt a server or network by flooding it with fake internet traffic. Malicious actors use DDoS attacks for financial , ideological, tactical, business motives and etc.
Victims of DDoS attacks usually notice that their network, website, or device is running slowly or is not providing service. 
However, these symptoms are not unique to DDoS attacks ,they can be caused by many things, such as a malfunctioning server, a surge in legitimate traffic, or even a broken cable. That’s why you cannot simply rely on manual observations, and instead should leverage a traffic analysis tool to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. Thus, implementing different Machine Learning (ML) , Deep learning to detect DDOS attack.

Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks fall on the category of critical attacks that compromise the availability of the network. These attacks have become sophisticated and continue to grow at a rapid pace so to detect and counter these attacks have become a challenging task. Thus , implementing machine learning-based detection and classification using ML classifiers KNN, SVM, QDA, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Classifier and XGBoost .Also implementing Deep learning algorithms using Deep neural network(DNN).
